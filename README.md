Polynomial interpolation is the interpolation of a givendata set by the polynomial of lowest possible degree that passes through the points of the dataset.
This helps us approximate points on complicated curves. The methods require tons of operations on different points along the curve and introduces matrix operations.
The methods that were used are Neville's method, Newton's forward method, Divided Difference method, and Cubine Spile interpolation. 

requirement.txt shows all the available packages when compiling this project on my system. Only NumPy was the only library used.
